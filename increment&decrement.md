# **Increment and decrement operators** 

### Increment and decrement operators are special types of operators in JavaScript that increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively.
#### ++: This is the increment operator. It increases the value of the variable by 1. There are two types of increment operators:
* Post-increment: When the operator is placed after the variable (e.g., x++), the value is first returned and then incremented.
* Pre-increment: When the operator is placed before the variable (e.g., ++x), the value is first incremented and then returned.

#### --: This is the decrement operator. It decreases the value of the variable by 1. Similar to the increment operator, there are two types of decrement operators:
* Post-decrement: When the operator is placed after the variable (e.g., x--), the value is first returned and then decremented.
* Pre-decrement: When the operator is placed before the variable (e.g., --x), the value is first decremented and then returned.

### These operators are commonly used in loops and other control structures where a variable needs to be increased or decreased by a fixed step.
