# Assignment Operators

#### Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables in JavaScript. Here is a list of the main assignment operators:

* **+=** This operator adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, **x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5**.
* **-=** This operator subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, **x -= 7 is equivalent to x = x - 7**.
* ***=** This operator multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, x *= 8 is equivalent to x = x * 8.
* **/=** This operator divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, **x /= 5 is equivalent to x = x / 5**.
* **%=** This operator calculates the modulus of the variable on the left and the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, **x %= 6 is equivalent to x = x % 6**.
* ****=** This operator raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable on the left. For example, **x** ****= 2 is equivalent to x = x ** 2**.

#### These assignment operators are used to simplify code and make it more readable. They perform the operation and assignment in a single step, which can be more efficient than performing the two steps separately.
